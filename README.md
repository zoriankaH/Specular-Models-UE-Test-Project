# Specular-Models-UE-Test-Project
 This is an UE project used within a bachelor thesis on the usage of different specular BRDFs in UE. 
 It is created in order to test and compare visuals and performance of the following additional specular shading models: Burley (Disney's), Blinn-Phong and Cook-Torrance specular models.
 In order to compile this project and have access to different specular models, use modified version of UE that can be accessed via the link: https://github.com/zoriankaH/UnrealEngine (In order to gain access to this repository, one needs to first request access to the UE source code as is described in the documentation https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/downloading-unreal-engine-source-code/)
