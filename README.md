# Specular-Models-UE-Test-Project
 This is an UE project used within a development of a bachelor thesis on the usage of different specular BRDFs in UE. 
 
 It is created in order to test and compare visuals and performance of the following additional specular shading models: Burley (Disney's), Blinn-Phong and Cook-Torrance specular models.
 
 In order to compile this project and have access to different specular models, use modified version of UE that can be accessed via the link: https://github.com/zoriankaH/UnrealEngine (In order to gain access to this repository, one needs to first request access to the UE source code as is described in the documentation https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/downloading-unreal-engine-source-code/)
 
 Packaged tests (for Windows platform) with different models, alongside the additional packages used in the test scenes, can be accessed via the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10aN8W07KNxoGnAUfh9UbHqjn9QzeanjK?usp=sharing
 
 ### NOTE: 
 
 - In order to correctly access the content of the packages, upon unpacking move the TwinmotionMaterials directory to the \Content\ directory.
 - You might have to rebuild the project using IDE
